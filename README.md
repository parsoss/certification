# What is it
this is an file for dufvnaxk certification.  
  
It's not a high-level algorithm or a using program,  
but it's what I used when I was studying. These files are generated in the process  
of authenticating self-development among people. After thinking about how to share it, I decided to use github.  
If you notice this, you can just skip it right away. You don't need to see it.
